# StatsUsage

**One menu bar. Every AI subscription's usage — at a glance.**

A native macOS menu-bar app (with an optional Dynamic-Island-style notch hub) that
unifies the usage quotas scattered across your AI subscriptions: official plan
limits, rolling usage windows with reset countdowns, third-party relay balances, and
local desktop-client account status — each value annotated with *freshness*,
*health*, and *reset confidence* so you can trust what you see.

## Highlights

- 🧭 **Notch-integrated hub** — a Dynamic-Island-style readout in opaque black that
  blends with the physical notch. The window is sized to fit the island exactly, so it
  never covers anything around it; hover to expand smoothly into a live usage panel.
  Falls back to a tidy floating pill on non-notched Macs.
- 📊 **Unified usage** — official plan quotas, rolling windows, relay balances, and
  local CLI account status in one place.
- ⏱ **Live reset timers** — a per-second ticking countdown to each window's reset, in
  the notch ear and beside every provider, so the time remaining is never stale.
- 🔎 **Trust metadata** — every number is tagged with freshness (`live` /
  `cachedFallback` / `empty`), health (`ok` / `authExpired` / `rateLimited` / …), and
  per-window reset confidence so stale or guessed values are never silently trusted.
- ⚙️ **Native settings** — a System-Settings-style preferences window (General, Menu
  Bar, Notch, Providers, About) with per-provider credentials, poll intervals, and
  alert thresholds.
- 🔐 **Secrets in the Keychain** — non-secret config is plain JSON with paranoid
  recovery; API keys and tokens live in the macOS Keychain.
- 📦 **Self-packaging & self-updating** — signs and bundles itself into a DMG and
  updates from a GitHub-hosted `latest.json`.
- 🪶 **Zero third-party dependencies** — pure Swift Package, layered by responsibility.

## Supported providers

| Family | Providers | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Official** | `codex`, `claude` | Local account status (reads local login state) |
| **Official** | `gemini` | Scaffolded — Cloud Code Assist endpoints |
| **Official** | `copilot`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, `jetbrains`, `kimi`, `openrouter*`, … | Registered placeholders, reported as not-yet-implemented |
| **Relay** | `relay`, `open`, `dragon` | NewAPI-style sites, described entirely by a JSON manifest — no code required |

See [`docs/PROVIDERS.md`](docs/PROVIDERS.md) for the full matrix and
[`docs/EXTENDING.md`](docs/EXTENDING.md) to onboard a new site.

## Install

1. Download **`StatsUsage.dmg`** from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/Raghaverma/UsageStats/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag **StatsUsage** into **Applications**.
3. Because the app is open-source and ad-hoc signed (not notarized under a paid
   Developer ID), the first launch is gated by Gatekeeper. **Right-click the app →
   Open → Open**, or run:

   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/StatsUsage.app
   ```

4. A gauge icon appears in the menu bar. Open **Settings → Providers** to enable
   providers and add credentials.

StatsUsage checks for updates automatically via a GitHub-hosted `latest.json`.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer
- Swift 6.2+ toolchain (Xcode 16.x) — only needed to build from source

## Quick start

```bash
swift build          # compile
swift run            # launch from source (a menu-bar icon appears)
swift test           # run the XCTest suite
./scripts/package_dmg.sh   # build a distributable DMG + ZIP into dist/
```

> `swift test` requires the full Xcode toolchain (for XCTest). If your active
> developer dir is the Command Line Tools, prefix the command with
> `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`.

## Architecture

The package is layered by responsibility; dependency arrows point inward toward the
dependency-free `Domain` contract:

| Target | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `StatsUsageDomain` | Pure `Sendable` models & enums (`UsageSnapshot`, `ProviderType`, …) |
| `StatsUsageApplication` | Refresh scheduler, backoff policy, alert engine |
| `StatsUsagePresentation` | View-state models & pure presenters |
| `StatsUsageProviders` | Slim fetching contract |
| `StatsUsageFeatures` | Feature assembly |
| `StatsUsageBootstrap` | Composition root |
| `StatsUsageInfrastructure` | Credential-store seam |
| `StatsUsage` (executable) | AppKit status item, SwiftUI UI, notch hub, concrete providers, relay engine, stores |

A boundary test (`ArchitectureBoundaryTests`) enforces that `Domain` and
`Application` never import AppKit/SwiftUI.

## Mental model

StatsUsage keeps a dictionary of `[providerID: UsageSnapshot]` fresh and renders it.
A **scheduler** drives a **factory-built set of providers** (official APIs, local
CLIs, or JSON-described relay sites) on one coalesced, jittered, backoff-aware poll
loop. Each provider returns a richly annotated snapshot which **pure presenters** turn
into menu-bar text, the notch hub, and popover cards. Config is non-secret JSON with
paranoid recovery; secrets live in the Keychain.

## The notch hub

The notch hub is hosted in a borderless, non-activating `NSPanel` pinned to the top of
the notched screen, using **public AppKit APIs only** (no private SkyLight/CGSSpace),
so it stays App Store-safe. The SwiftUI hub measures its own size and reports it up
through a `NotchLayoutBridge`; the controller then **resizes the panel to fit the
island exactly**. Because the window is never larger than the visible hub, there is no
transparent dead zone over other apps and no mouse-passthrough trickery is needed.

- **Collapsed** — an opaque-black island that straddles the notch with a compact
  readout on each ear (status dot + remaining %, and a live reset timer). The black
  fill blends with the physical notch instead of leaking out as a translucent box.
- **Expanded (on hover)** — smoothly (no bounce) expands into a panel listing every
  enabled provider with an animated progress ring, name, per-window live countdowns,
  and quick Refresh / Settings actions. Providers still waiting on data stay listed.

Toggle it, pick the primary provider, and disable hover-to-expand in **Settings**.

## Building & distributing

The app ships as a self-contained DMG built straight from the SwiftPM release binary —
no Xcode project required.

### Build a DMG locally

```bash
./scripts/package_dmg.sh
```

This builds `swift build -c release`, assembles `StatsUsage.app` (Info.plist, icon,
resource bundle), code-signs it, and writes both artifacts to `dist/`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dist/StatsUsage.dmg` | Drag-to-Applications disk image for end users |
| `dist/StatsUsage-macOS.zip` | Zipped `.app`, used by the in-app updater |

Override the version with `APP_VERSION=0.2.0 ./scripts/package_dmg.sh` (otherwise it
reads the `VERSION` file).

### Signing levels

| Goal | Command |
| --- | --- |
| **Ad-hoc** (open-source default; users right-click → Open) | `./scripts/package_dmg.sh` |
| **Developer ID** (no Gatekeeper prompt, requires a paid Apple Developer account) | `DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./scripts/package_dmg.sh` |
| **Developer ID + notarized** (best experience) | `NOTARIZE_DMG=1 NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE=my-profile DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./scripts/package_dmg.sh` |

> The `NOTARYTOOL_PROFILE` is a stored `notarytool` keychain profile — create one once
> with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials my-profile --apple-id you@example.com
> --team-id TEAMID` (you'll be prompted for an app-specific password).

### Publish a release (recommended)

Distribution is fully automated by [`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml).
To cut a release, just tag it:

```bash
# 1. Make sure the build is green
swift build && swift test

# 2. Bump the version and commit
echo 0.2.0 > VERSION && git commit -am "Release 0.2.0"

# 3. Tag and push — the workflow does the rest
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin main --tags
```

The workflow then builds the DMG + ZIP, generates and validates `latest.json`, and
publishes a GitHub Release with all three assets attached — which is exactly what the
**Install** section above and the in-app updater download from. See
[`docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md) for the full checklist.

> Want zero Gatekeeper friction for users? Add your Developer ID and notarization
> secrets to the repository and pass them through to `package_dmg.sh` in the workflow.
